        <p>
            0.83 switches to use of Sindre Sorhus' LaunchAtLogin library, adds a few new clippings options, and corrects a minor issue with the status item behavior. The earliest version of macOS supported is now 10.12 (Sierra).
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>New option to move clippings to the top of the list after they are used.</li>
            <li>New option to record whitespace-only clippings.</li>
            <li>The status item menu now appears on mouse-down, rather than mouse-up.</li>
            <li>Jumpcut displays an alert on launch if it will not be able to save the clippings
                due to permissions issues in the Application Support directory.</li>
            <li>Jumpcut now uses Sindre Sorhus' LaunchAtLogin library, for better compatibility
                across the range of macOS versions supported by the application.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As always, please report any bugs or feature requests on GitHub. Thanks for using Jumpcut!</p>
